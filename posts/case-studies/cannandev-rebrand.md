## Accessible
Lighthouse score before and now. Screen reader-friendly, functional images (not just decorative), color contrast, keyboard accessible, semantic headings, page flow of landmarks.
## Move the focus away from me
Focus on issues and advice colleagues and friends have asked about that can help people entering the field.
## Help you jump in and get started
Teach skills in a way to get started or start implementing methodologies on a current project, instead of reading paragraph after paragraph of a case study. Tutorials re-written in a way that someone with cognitive impairment (like me) doesn't have to struggle to think or remember.
## User-centered design based on research
Found out who my audience is and what they'd like to learn about. How can I help?
